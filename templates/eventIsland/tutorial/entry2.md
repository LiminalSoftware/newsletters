Copy for entry 2:

* this is an unordered list
* it has bullets next to its items
 * to create a sub-point use a space...
 * ...at the beginning of the line
* see how it works?


1. this is an ordered list
1. it has numbers next to its items
1. you can just use '1.' for each entry
1. and the system will automatically use the correct number
 1. sub-points work the same in ordered lists
1. you can even switch between unordered and ordered when you change levels of indentation
 * like this - see

To separate two lists from each other, you must use 2 empty lines like above, see?
