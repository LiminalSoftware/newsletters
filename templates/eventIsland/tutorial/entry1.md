I'm like the title but a little bit different. You can click to edit me as well but I have special features.

For example, you can create links out of any of my text. 
[This is an example of a link](http://www.google.com).
The words inside the [ ] are the text of the link, and the URL inside the ( ) is the URL that link links to.

You can also create paragraphs with 1 blank line in between the paragraphs.
A new line will not create a new paragraph without a blank line in between.
These three sentences are an example of that.
